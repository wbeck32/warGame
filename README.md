# War

This is an interpretation of the game War that I built in JavaScript.

[Rules of the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game))

I tried to use as many of the new ES6 features as I could so I added Babel to transpile the code for maximum compatibility.

There are still some TODOs in the code. The biggest one is that my dealing algorithm doesn't work correctly.

To try it:

`git clone https://github.com/wbeck32/warGame.git`

then

`npm install`

to build the app and run the tests use

`npm start`
